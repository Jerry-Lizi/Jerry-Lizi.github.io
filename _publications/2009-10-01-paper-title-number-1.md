title: "Supporting Interest-Based User Classification on Social Media Using a Mixed-Initiative Approach"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: '• We present DuoTag, a classification system designed to assist analysts in the accurate, scalable classification of social media users by their interests. DuoTag combines visualization techniques that present user information and classification outcomes with interaction that supports analysts labeling and refining results.

• We developed a mixed-initiative framework by combining semi-supervised and active learning. This framework incorporates human expertise into the machine learning process through iterative feedback on ambiguous cases, step-by-step refinement, and adaptive model training, allowing for effective classification with limited labeled data.

• We conducted an evaluation of \name, including experiments that tested algorithm performance, case studies showcasing real-world applications, and a user study to assess usability. The results indicate that DuoTag enables scalable, interest-based user classification on social media, achieving accuracy while reducing the manual effort required for labeling.'

User classification on social media involves categorizing individuals based on their interests, behaviors, or demographics, which is essential for applications such as targeted advertising, content recommendation, and identifying influential users. Interest-based classification, in particular, offers better stability over time and enhances user privacy. However, this process faces challenges, notably data sparsity among less active users and the considerable effort required to obtain labeled training data. To address these challenges, we present DuoTag, a mixed-initiative system designed specifically for interest-based user classification on social media. Our approach employs a multi-step workflow that begins with automated classifications based on user-interest similarities. This initial step is followed by the curation of a training dataset, which is labeled with the assistance of analysts, thus integrating human expertise into the machine learning process. DuoTag also incorporates visualization and interaction that facilitate analysts in labeling users and refining classification results. We evaluated DuoTag through two experiments, two case studies, and a user study. The results indicate that DuoTag effectively supports scalable and precise interest-based user classification on social media, minimizing the manual labeling effort required.
